This year, I worked with our digital designer to add a modernized basic template that is responsive and uses a new menu that makes us of Drupal’s menu system so it could be maintained by Drupal’s GUI.

I created a “pterosaur tracker” that used the Google maps API and JS to show a pterosaur fly across the U.S., making stops on its way to the museum. </p><p>I utilized the JS Canvas API to create an image that would follow the rotational position of the KML points which gave a feeling of the pterosaur actually flying. I used requestAnimationFrame and the rendering engine which provided the pterosaur flying on the Google Map with 60fps, allowing fluid animation and preventing jitter.</p>"
